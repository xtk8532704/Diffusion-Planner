"""Group a curated flat JSON path list into per-site npz roots.

A "site" is inferred from the path component immediately before the first recognized split
dir (``_SPLIT_DIR_NAMES``) in each JSON entry, following the existing
``{project}/{area_map_id}_{area_map_name}/{split}/...`` layout convention. Each site's routes
are evaluated independently — callers must never merge multiple sites' npz under one
``--npz_root``/``rglob``, since route grouping is filename-only and ignores directory
structure (see route_timeline.route_prefix); mixing sites risks silently merging unrelated
routes that happen to share a bag-name prefix.

``split`` is ``valid`` for the label-based downloader's original layout, or ``manual``/``auto``
for the PR253 ros_scripts reorg (train/valid -> manual, auto stays auto) — both conventions
coexist across existing datasets, so all three are checked.

The path component one level above the site is the ``project`` -- a data-collection
campaign name, not a vehicle model (several projects can share one vehicle). This module
has no built-in project->vehicle mapping; pass one via ``project_vehicle_map`` in
:func:`discover_sites_with_vehicles_from_json` if needed. The JSON file it is loaded from is
supplied at runtime and is not tracked in this repository (``*project_vehicle_map*.json`` is
gitignored).

    With no map at all, ``vehicle_type`` is left ``""`` -- a project is a data-collection
    campaign name and not a vehicle model, so labelling sites with it would report something
    the caller never asked for. Only a project missing from a map that *was* supplied falls
    back to the raw project name, with a warning. Downstream consumers already treat ``""``
    as "unlabelled" (the report hides the column, the W&B rollup omits the per-vehicle keys).

    Returns ``{site_key: {"npz_roots": [Path, ...], "vehicle_type": str, "project": str}}``.

    Grouping is keyed on ``(project, site)``; ``vehicle_type`` is a label only and never
    merges roots. Several projects can share one vehicle, so keying on the vehicle would pool
    two projects' routes under one site key and leave ``project`` describing only whichever
    was seen first. If one site name appears under N projects, all N are kept as separate
