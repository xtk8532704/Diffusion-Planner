"""Group a curated flat JSON path list into per-site npz roots.

A "site" is inferred from the path component immediately before the first recognized split
dir (``_SPLIT_DIR_NAMES``) in each JSON entry, following the existing
``{project}/{area_map_id}_{area_map_name}/{split}/...`` layout convention (e.g.
``x2_dev/2231_odaiba_shinagawa_copied_from_xx1``). Each site's routes are evaluated
independently — callers must never merge multiple sites' npz under one
``--npz_root``/``rglob``, since route grouping is filename-only and ignores directory
structure (see route_timeline.route_prefix); mixing sites risks silently merging unrelated
routes that happen to share a bag-name prefix.

``split`` is ``valid`` for the label-based downloader's original layout, or ``manual``/``auto``
for the PR253 ros_scripts reorg (train/valid -> manual, auto stays auto) — both conventions
coexist across existing datasets, so all three are checked.
